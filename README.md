# Partner day 2025
Demo repository for showcasing Kaoto for the Partner day

## Context
The goal for this demo is to show how can we consume data from a rest endpoint and perform data mapping process to the XML payload.
We're gonna use variables to leverage the information coming from different endpoints and we're gonna explore how to print them out to the terminal for quick prototyping and lastly save the transformed data into files.

## steps
1. Create a new Route using the Kaoto perspective
2. Create a separate route to fetch information from the `/account` endpoint
3. Store the data into the account variable
4. Create a separate route to fetch information from the `/cart` endpoints
5. Show the data in the terminal
6. Perform data mapping between the two XML documents
7. Print the resulting document to the terminal
8. Store the documents into files
